```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

A set of time and cost (import/compute) saving functions as tools:
  
- **db_histogram** - Calculates the bins of a Histogram inside the database. And by default returns a data frame with the values.  When the **output** argument is changed to **ggplot** the function will return a geom_bar ggplot, which meant for a quick plot view.

- **db_raster** - Groups and aggregates the values of two variables so as to allow a large dataset to be visualized.  When the **output** argument is changed to **ggplot** the function will return a geom_bar ggplot, which meant for a quick plot view.
